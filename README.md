# RajParekh_FrontEndLab-ReactJS

  The folder "expense-tracker" consits of 2 sub-folders:
      
      1. client - Display + Logic of application
      
      2. server - Backend server for fetching and storing details
      
    
    The src under client contains 3 sub-folers:
      1. component
          Contains the logic for implementing the expense tracking with TypeScript functionalities
          
      2. models
          Contains the interface of details of the app
          
      3. service
          Contains the logic shared by the component
          
          
    I have also added a pdf named "Screenshot" for reference on Application display and interaction.
